# A tiny programming language demo

In this directory is a tiny HTML video game. To see the source, look at [index.html](index.html). To run it, try downloading http-server using `npm install -g http-server` and then run

	http-server -o

In this game, point a mouse and click to blow up the UFOs.

There is a simple programming language which scripts the movement of the UFOs. By this commit, they "chase" the player, and flee from the player's shots.
